522
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,090
You're our only hope.

523
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,430
-[Amon exclaims]
-[gasps]

524
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,970
[dramatic music
continues on TV]

525
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,720
[gasping]

526
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,750
-Wizards.
-[chuckles]

527
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,420
I can fix it. Don't worry.

528
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,520
I'm not a wizard.
[tense breathing]

529
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,630
[laughing] Hey, Mom.
He's awake.

530
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,560
I told you
not to go in your room.

531
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,770
It was you who spoke.

532
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,700
You woke me.

533
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,170
I didn't have a choice.
I'd be dead
if it hadn't worked.

534
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,840
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

535
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,240
-Yes.
-Then your enemies
are vanquished,

536
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,040
condemned to
the eternal sleep
of the damned.

537
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,950
Actually, we still have
a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing.

538
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,620
Then destroy them.

539
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,950
Intergang have
guns and flybikes
and Eternium rockets.

540
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,290
We have my mom.

541
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,090
Prove your strength.

542
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,820
Destroy your enemy
and all he cares about.

543
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,120
Make him beg for mercy,

544
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,560
but deny it
until his final breath.

545
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,000
Interesting, okay?

546
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,500
I appreciate
what you did for me,

547
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,070
but I do not want you
teaching my son violence.

548
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,370
I understand.
You want his father

549
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,810
-to teach him violence.
-[coughs]

550
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,640
-Gross, that's my brother.
-That's my sister.

551
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,780
-His father's dead.
-I'm sorry.

552
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,210
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

553
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,920
Yeah, Mom. Who do you want
to teach me violence?

554
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,450
No one.

555
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,620
I want a champion to help
free Kahndaq from Intergang.

556
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,360
Please, help us.

557
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,570
[panting]

558
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,810
[Amon] Wait! Wait.

559
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,110
-Where are you going?
-I shouldn't be here.

560
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,280
You don't feel any loyalty
to us at all?

561
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,720
Not really, no.

562
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,320
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

563
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,120
I don't know what it was like
in ancient times,

564
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,420
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal
in our world.

565
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,090
Maybe clean up your outfit
a little bit,

566
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,360
get a cape, change your name.

567
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,190
Teth Adam is
a very strong name.

568
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,530
It's a little outdated.

569
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,130
And you definitely
need a catchphrase.

570
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,600
Something blackout
bad-ass to say

571
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,070
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

572
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,470
I don't waste words
on the dead.

573
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,340
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

574
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,670
I was thinking, like,

575
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,980
"Tell them the Man in Black
sent you."

576
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,440
-Them?
-You know, gods, demons...

577
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,350
Whoever's waiting for us
in the afterlife.

578
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,380
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really
lean into that.

579
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,180
My point is,
you could be famous.

580
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,990
Magazines, lunch boxes,
video games.

581
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,190
And the superhero
industrial complex
is worth a lot of money.

582
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,220
I don't need a box
for my lunch.

583
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,260
Anyone you've ever known
is dead.

584
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,530
What else
are you gonna do?

585
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,400
[people exclaiming]

586
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,470
Wait! Where are you going?

587
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,170
[people chattering excitedly]

588
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,660
Waller's file needs a bit
to be desired.

589
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,520
Most of this was
considered a myth

590
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,430
until yesterday afternoon.

591
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,700
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

592
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,800
When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,

593
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,270
you cease to believe
in absolutes.

594
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,140
[wry chuckle]

595
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,040
What are you laughing at?

596
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,710
I'm not laughing.
That was a smirk.

597
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,210
I know.
That's how you laugh.

598
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,540
I've missed
having you around

599
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,550
to spout old cryptic shit
like that.

600
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,580
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around

601
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,280
to ignore all my advice.
Carter...

602
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,520
This is not
a very good plan.

603
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,530
Yeah, well...

604
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,900
A bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

605
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,870
If only there were
a third option.

606
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,710
[Cyclone] I wouldn't touch that
if I was you.

607
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,710
Why not?

608
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,380
'Cause that helmet
is from another planet.

609
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,680
It's millions of years old.

610
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,680
It chooses
who it lets touch it.

611
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,450
-Like Kent?
-Yeah.

612
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,150
Like, Kent is literally
possessed when he puts it on.

613
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,590
What happens
if I touch it anyway?

614
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,790
Soul crushing terror?
Or... something.

615
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,930
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

616
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,300
[Hawkman] Coming up on it.

617
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,460
Ready stations in five.

618
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,070
Hey, why is this Adam dude
so pissed off?

619
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,330
[Carter]
He's not some dude.

620
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,440
He's a weapon
of mass destruction.

621
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,310
You don't have to
raise your hand.

622
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,980
Question, if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed
to stop him?

623
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,150
If we can get him
to say the word, "Shazam,"

624
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,310
Teth Adam
will lose his power.

625
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,680
And we're hoping
since he's had

626
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,050
a few thousand years
to sleep it off,

627
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,350
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

628
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,560
From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like

629
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,790
a "peacefully negotiate"
kind of guy.

630
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,090
Correct.

631
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,430
Look alive.

632
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:49,870
We're here.

633
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,700
[sighing]

634
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,810
-[entry bell chimes]
-[townspeople chattering]

635
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,570

636
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,810
[wailing]

637
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,440
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

638
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,430
Forgive me.

639
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,850
[indistinct chatter]

640
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,690
[Amon] This is a message

641
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,130
-for all Intergang soldiers.
-Hey! Stop!

642
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,690
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

643
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,870
[grunting loudly]

644
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,420
Teth Adam!

645
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,390
[quietly] Please.

646
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,490
-There he is! Move!
-[people exclaiming]

647
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,230
-Teth Adam!
-[checkpoint leader] Move!

648
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,360
-Teth Adam--! [grunting]
-[grunts]

649
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,370
Get up! Who's gonna
save you now, mate?

650
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,940
The statue?

651
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,010
[Adrianna] That's my son.

652
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,680
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

653
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,410
What are you doing?

654
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,350
Hang on. I recognize you.

655
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,920
Where is the crown?

656
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,660
-[grunting]
-Let's go!

657
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,890
[Adrianna grunts]

658
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,830
[crowd murmuring]

659
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,040
[screaming faintly]

660
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,500
You could've showed up
a bit sooner.

661
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,840
But that was dope.

662
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,650
We need backup down here.

663
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,810
[gun clicking]

664
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:36,200

The Bad And The Ugly" playing]

[screams, grunts]

668
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,220
[Amon laughs]

669
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,850
Tell them
the Man in Black sent you.

670
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,860
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

671
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,430
But before you zap them.

672
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,200
-Catchphrase, then kill.
-Yes.

673
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,660

[grunts]

676
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,190
He's here.

677
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,320
You sense his presence?

678
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,360
No.

679
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,760
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

680
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,930
[Cyclone gasps]

681
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,630
[soldiers gasping, whimpering]

682
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,540
Fate and I'll take the lead.
Listen...

683
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,580
Now, you two hang back
'til we call you.

684
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,240
We're the anvil,
you're the hammer.

685
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,850
You're ready.

686
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,610
-[soldiers screaming]
-Uh, he just dropped the, um...

687
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,620
-[soldiers screaming faintly]
-Shit!

688
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,550
[wind whistling]

689
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,890
Be prepared.

[electronic alert beeping]

691
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,830
Um...

[both yelling]

694
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,010
Behind you!

[crowd jeering]

698
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,930
Let us be!

699
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,600
I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,

700
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,800
these men should face
due process.

701
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,800
[crowd cheering]

702
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,570
Then let the gods
make their judgment.

703
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,070
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

704
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,340
You don't look like
an Intergang.

705
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,780
We're the Justice Society.

706
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,050
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

707
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,650
We're here
to restore peace
to Kahndaq.

708
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,750
And we will use force
if necessary.

709
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,620
Force is always necessary.

710
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,130
[Dr. Fate] Teth Adam.

711
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,860
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

712
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,730
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

713
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,200
You have two choices.

714
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,770
Kneel or die.

715
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,770
I was a slave until I died.

716
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,080
Then I was reborn a God.

717
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,880
I kneel before no one.

719
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,190

[people screaming]

721
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,850

We all go home.

723
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,720

Whoo!

731
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,090
Look at that suit.
It's cool.

732
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,950
-Thanks. You, too.
-Thank you.

733
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,890
It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

[Teth Adam
and Hawkman grunting]

735
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,500
[Atom Smasher] Hawkman just
does not give up, does he?

736
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,800
[Cyclone] Nope.

737
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,810

Wait!

now is your time.

-[beeps]
-Let's roll!

00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,810

Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

753
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,460
I'll be right there!

I got him! Guys, I got him.

776
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,320
It's, uh... it's me, Al.
In case you didn't
recognize me.

777
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,920
There's something different
about you.

778
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,520
Can't quite
put my finger on it.

779
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,320
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

780
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,990
But you--
You're like a tornado.

781
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,490
I thought the two of you
did great work.

782
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,530
First time out--
[clicks teeth] Bravo.

783
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,060
Thanks. I mean, I got a little
turned around back there,

784
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,630
but, uh,
it all worked out, right?

785
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,170
You're damn right it did.

786
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,070
Let's hope Waller has
that cell ready for him.

00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,570
[powerful rumbling]

00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,170
[televisions crackling]

789
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,780
[grunting] You want me
to keep my hand here, right?

790
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,050
You'd better not let him up.

791
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,510
[rumbling increases]

792
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,620

What do I do?
Guys?

[loud grunt]

794
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,620
Whoo-hoo!

00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,770
[crowd chanting]
Long live the Champion!

796
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,200
Long live the Champion!

797
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,370
Long live the Champion!

798
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,610
Long live the Champion!

[breath rumbling]

801
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,320
Yeah, he's definitely
still breathing.

802
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:29,020
Long live the Champion!
Long live the Champion!

803
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,330
[chanting continues]

804
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,570
[chanting subsides]

805
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,140
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

806
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,710
We're not strong enough.

807
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,350
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction

808
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,890
to figure that out
before we get
our asses kicked.

809
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,620
I'm working on it.

810
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,820
Miss?

811
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,720
Excuse me, you mind
if I look in your bag?

812
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,030
Yes, I do mind.

813
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,430
Where are you going
with this, Kent?

814
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,990
She's got
the Crown of Sabbac.

815
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,630
[Hawkman]
One catastrophe at a time.

816
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,360
We can't give him
a chance to regroup.

817
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,200
He's been spotted
entering the palace.

818
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,230
It's safe to say he's not
going there to surrender.

819
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,800
Why do you want
Teth Adam to surrender?

820
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,170
He's the Champion of Kahndaq.
Who are you?

821
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,170
The Justice Society?

822
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,440
We have been living
under military occupation

823
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,010
for 27 years,
and never seen you before.

824
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,780
You didn't come
when Intergang
invaded our country,

825
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,520
when they stole
our resources
and killed my husband.

826
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,990
But now, we finally
have our own hero

827
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,290
and you decide
to fly down here
and save us?

828
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,860
Thank you, but...
we're covered.

829
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,700
Go and protect international
stability someplace else.

830
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,230
Oh, and second,
I don't have the crown.

831
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,270
Let me spell it out
for you.

832
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,270
Teth Adam can't be
Kahndaq's champion,

833
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,040
because he is not a hero.

834
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,110
Tell that...

835
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,180
to all the people
he just liberated.

836
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,510
I know what this looks like.
I... I do.

837
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,980
But I can assure you
that my t--

838
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,820
-[loud crashing]
-[gasps]

839
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,350
[all exclaiming]

840
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,750
I am so sorry.
Was that expensive?

841
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,960
Me and you.
When we get back
to the ship...

842
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,660
-Yes, sir.
-Me and you.

843
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,260
I...

844
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,300
Can we please
just see the crown?

845
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,130
I don't have it.

846
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,610
[indistinct chatter]

847
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,240
[horns honking]

848
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,050
We don't have time for this.

849
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,060
Teth Adam first,
then the crown.

850
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,420
You don't have
any authority here.

851
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,660
Teth Adam has done nothing--

852
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,490
Teth Adam is not
who you think he is.

853
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,130
And how would you know?

854
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,600
We have access
to ancient texts

855
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,670
that have been kept secret
for centuries.

856
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,400
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

857
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,570
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

858
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,140
And we flew
all the way over here

859
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,380
to stop it
from happening again.

860
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,050
[Hawkman] You want to
go in there alone?

861
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,750
Are you sure?

862
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,490
You want to go in
and fight Teth Adam again,
be my guest.

863
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,860
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

864
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,190
without destroying
the rest of my city,

865
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,560
I'm your only shot.

866
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,220
[Teth Adam] You brought
the invaders with you.

867
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,450
They only want to talk.

868
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,790
They can talk.
I won't listen.

869
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,230
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother
told me the story

870
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:54,260
of how the Champion came
to this exact spot

871
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,100
to free the enslaved people
of Kahndaq

872
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,230
by defeating King Ahk-Ton
in battle.

873
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,270
But according
to the Justice Society,

874
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,970
that's not really
what happened.

875
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,970
They say that you didn't
come here to seek justice.

876
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,780
[King Ahk-Ton
speaking in Kahndaqi]

877
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:09,620
Hurry.

878
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,120
Give it to me!

879
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,720
[crowd exclaiming]

880
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,350
[Adrianna] <i>That you came</i>
<i>to exact revenge.</i>

881
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,340
<i>And in your anger...</i>

882
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,000
[energy crackling]

883
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,410
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

884
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:40,400
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

885
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,450
[Adrianna] <i>...your power grew,</i>
<i>until it became uncontrollable.</i>

886
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,110
This is what I want.

887
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,350
[people screaming]

888
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,690
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy

889
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,530
of the gifts that
you were granted.

890
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,430
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

891
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,460
We have chosen recklessly...

892
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:03,420
...and humanity has paid the price.

893
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,430
And now, Teth Adam...

894
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,140
...you must pay.

895
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,820
[energy building]

896
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,320
[screaming]

897
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,360
It wasn't your tomb
that I opened, was it?

898
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:32,930
It was your prison.

899
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,900
And, now, there's
a statue of you.

900
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:40,740
Out of the hope that
someday Kahndaq's champion
would return.

901
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,510
But it's built on a lie,
isn't it?

902
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,570
[Teth Adam]
I never said
I was a hero.

903
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,780
I never claimed
to be anything.

904
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,250
You may not have
been a hero.

905
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,350
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

906
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,960
I will hear them out.

907
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,530
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

908
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,460
[door unlocks, opens]

909
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,900
Uncle Karim!

910
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:12,340
I can't believe
you're sitting around
watching TV

911
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,670
when the most
epic day ever is--

912
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,370
-[Ishmael] In here, little man.
-[gasps]

913
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,210
Ishmael! My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

914
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,640
Funny story, he didn't.

915
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,710
-[laughs]
-Where's Adrianna?

916
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,950
She's back
at the square--

917
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,350
We should go bail her out
right now.

918
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,480
But she's the one
who sent me home

919
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,680
to make sure
the crown's safe.

920
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,490
It is safe, okay?
Somewhere else.

921
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,860
-Definitely not here. Let--
-Okay--

922
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,420
-Put the bag down.
-What are you doing?

923
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:37,090
Back away.
Put the bag down, now.

924
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,900
Give him the bag.
Give him the bag.

925
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,730
[crown clanking]

926
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,100
Very good. Back away.

927
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,070
-Back away.
-Okay, I'm--

928
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,810
[bag unzips]

929
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,980
[Ishmael] It's all going
to be okay, little man.

930
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,420
Let me teach you
some history that
you've never learned

931
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,720
in one of your
mother's classes.

932
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,350
When we had
a powerful king,

933
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:09,190
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

934
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,530
It used to be great.

935
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,230
Run, Amon, run!

936
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,660

Crash the building.

941
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,720
I lost the kid.
He has the crown.

942
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,830
[Hawkman] We're here
to negotiate the terms

943
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,400
of your
peaceful surrender.

944
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,840
I'm not peaceful.
Nor do I surrender.

945
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:00,210
[Dr. Fate] What have
your powers ever given
to you?

946
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,240
Nothing but heartache.

947
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,680
You have no idea.

948
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,250
Then why are you
making this
hard on us?

949
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,720
We both know
you're not supposed
to be here.

950
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,150
It is you
who is not supposed
to be here.

951
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,860
I want you all
to leave Kahndaq
and never return.

952
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,790
Gladly,
with you as our prisoner.

953
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,490
How 'bout I rip
your little wings off
instead?

954
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,000
I'd like to see you try.

955
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,770
Okay, more fighting
won't solve this.

956
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:24,100
-I disagree.
-Me, too.

957
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,800
Looks like we found
common ground.

958
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,600
This can only end
one way.

-[Amon] <i>Mom?</i>
-Amon.

961
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,610
I got home and Ishmael
was in the kitchen.

962
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,010
Ishmael's dead.

963
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,080
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

and Intergang's here.

They're coming!

Intergang are
after my son.

969
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,290
They don't want him,
they want
the Crown of Sabbac.

970
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,560
I know you're not a hero.

971
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,790
But you're not a monster,
either.

972
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,430
I don't care
what anyone says.

973
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,300
You saved me
in that cave.

974
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,470
You didn't know me
and your first instinct
was to save me.

975
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,270
I'm begging you.
Please, save my son.

976

the whole place clean.

with your word choice
next time.

I don't really have

It's my uncle's.
I'll get it tailored.

-Who are you?
-Call me Dr. Fate.

01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:15,750
How bad is it, Doc?
Am I dying?

1066
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,190
I'm not that kind of doctor.

1067
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,090
But don't worry,
I can see the future.

1068

This isn't how you're
going to die.

1069
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,660
How do I die, then?

1070
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:24,330
Just stay away
from electricity.

1071

Wait, what?
I'm an electrician.

The nanobots did
most of the work.

No, no, no. I'm not gonna
let you downplay this.

What? I say something stupid?

1110

No, it's just you can transform

your own size.

as nanobots.

That's how you do
your wind thing.

Well, the "wind thing"
is called aerokinesis.

1119

It's already moved on
from you.

Why did you say that?

1131
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,700
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

1133

we shouldn't hurt

We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

[Adrianna] No.

You'd better not drop
those prisoners.

I'm not going to drop them.

I'm going to drop
one of them.

Where is he?

You said you wouldn't
hurt the prisoners.

That was sarcasm.

1177
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,850
No, technically,
it was just a lie.

I told you,
stop killing people!

They look alive to me.

1185
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,800
Because I saved them.

1186
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,540
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

1187
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,870
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

1188

I did it your way.

He does have a point.

I know it got lost
in all the confusion,

1191
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,850
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

1192
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:19,050
We know where Amon is.
We have to go.

1193

There is no "we" here.

1194
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,920
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

1195
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,520
You think yourself a hero,

1196
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,360
but you would let these
criminals go free,

1197
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,330
knowing that many more
will suffer at their hands

1198

unless we end them now.

1199
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,000
Heroes don't kill people.

Well, I do.

Twenty-three pounds

No, it snapped

What's that?

1215
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,580
There's writing on the inside

"Life is the only path

...you'll be safe.

1403
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,020
I couldn't protect your mother.

1404
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,640
Repeat what I say.

1405
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,610

It's Hurut.

1422
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,230
My son dreamt of
a better world.

1423
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,060
That's why he saved me.

1424
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:33,140
But the world was only
a better place with him in it.

1425
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:50,720
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1426
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,160
Instead, it got me.

1427
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,600
All this power...

1428
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:02,130
And the only thing
I can do with it is
hurt people.

1429
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:05,940
I will speak the word
my son gave me,

1430
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,570
and I will give up
my power.

1431
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:14,140
And when I do,
you must ensure
I never speak it again.

...to be heroes.

1437
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:18,910
Hey!

1438
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,330
[chuckling] So beautiful.

1439
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,120
Surprised to see us?

1440
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:10,260
Surprise is a dirty word
in this business.

1441
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,890
Are you sure
you can handle him?

1442
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,630
You're the one who can
see the future,

1443
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,100
you'll tell me if we can't.

1444
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:18,500
Just be careful with this one.

1445
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:21,000
You know,
they say the gods created us,

1446
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:23,740
but we're the ones
who always wind up
burying them.

Hey! There he is.

1454
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,870
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1455
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,600
-[laughs]
-Well, statistically,

1456
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:27,900
most heroes don't wear capes.
But yeah, try it on.

1457
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:33,410
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1458
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,210
[light wind blowing]

1459
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,980
That's a nice touch.

[Dr. Fate moans]

Kent.

-Kent!
-[gasps]

1469
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:26,700
Mission accomplished?

1470
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,830
My vision hasn't changed.

1471
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,030
But Teth Adam's
out of the equation.

1472
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,940
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know
what's coming.

1473
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,840
What is the helmet
telling you?

1474
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:40,540
My vision has always
shown me
a great calamity.

1475
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:42,850
The world in flames.

1476
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,080
We can stop it...

1477
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,420
but you die.

1478
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,850
You should've
told me sooner.

1479
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,830
I have no fear of death.

1480
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,030
That's precisely
why I didn't tell you.

1481
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:00,400
The world needs
the Justice Society.

1482
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,160
The world needs you.

1483
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,700
But you can't choose
who lives and dies.

1484
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,640
That's Fate, right?

1485
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,640
[rueful chuckle]

1486
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:11,510
That sounds familiar.

1487
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:16,110
I remember seeing
my first airplane.

1488
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:22,690
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1489
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,150
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1490
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,390
Mm.

1491
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:28,860
But I didn't cheer.

1492
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,060
Even though I was only a boy.

1493
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:37,770
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1494
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,430
Thanks to this,
I've lived longer

1495
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,600
than I could've
ever have hoped for.

1496
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:43,370
I've seen the world change

1497
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,540
in more ways
than I could've imagined.

1498
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,550
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1499
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:53,880
And I don't want
my friend to die.

1500
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,990
[sighs]

1501
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,730
Ishmael said, "Death
is the only path to life."

1502
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,070
But that's not
what the inscription says.

1503
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,770
Right. "Life is the only
path to death."

1504
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,970
Maybe he got it backwards,

1505
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,440
like he read it in a mirror
or something.

1506
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:17,910
That's it.

1507
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:20,380
In Kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned

1508

are sent
to the Rock of Finality.

1509

The underworld
is a mirror to our own.

Here, turn the crown around.

1511
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,520
Now mirror the letters.

1512
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:32,620
See? That's what I missed.

1513
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:36,490
"Death is the only
path to life."

I never thought
I'd be happy

I'm only here
because of him.

1762

See you around, old friend.

Think you can keep him
out of trouble?

1767
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,980
As long as no one
comes looking for it.

1768
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:52,650
[Hawkman] Fair enough.

1769
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,750
Just be careful.

1770
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:58,990
The kind of justice
you dish out
can darken your soul.

1771
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:01,660
It's his darkness
that lets him do

1772
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,360
what heroes

I guess we'll find out,
won't we?

1775
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:18,170
I thought we made
a pretty good team back there.

1776
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:20,040
Just saying.

1777
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:23,010

-Don't push it.

01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:32,760

Long live the Champion!

1783
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:55,680

Wrong.

1787
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:47,330
[Amon] So... what now?

1788
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:49,830
Does this mean you're finally
gonna be our hero?

1789
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:51,900
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1790
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,240
And it still does.

1791
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:58,010
What it needs now
is a protector.

1792
01:52:58,070 --> 01:52:59,810
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1793
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:02,850
[Teth Adam] Perhaps
that name is a little...

1794
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:04,180
old-fashioned.

1795
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,050
